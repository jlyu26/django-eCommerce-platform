## Understanding CRUD

CRUD handles database-related actions.

Actions into the database | HTTP methods:
- Create -- POST
- Retrieve / List / Search -- GET
- Update -- PUT / PATCH
- Delete -- DELETE

## Models

A model is how we connect Django to database. Like writing fields in database, very similar to creating a form.

Document: [Model field reference](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/models/fields/)

Everytime we save/update our model, first use `python manage.py makemigrations`, then `python manage.py migrate`.

Model managers: in QuerySet `qs = Product.objects.filter(id=pk)`, object is considered a model manager, while filter() is a model manager method that allows us to do the queryset. Model managers make is easier for us to make lookups. To make model manager more effective, we extending the default `objects` it in `models.py`.

## Views

There are function-based views (easier to understand) and class-based views (which is more robust).
